   <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
   <p>There was once a <em>powerful</em> lion called <strong>Bhasuraka</strong> who ruled the jungle.
        He was <dfn>merciless and killed other animals</dfn> indiscriminately.
        One day, all the animals went together to the lion to surrender. 
        They said, <q>O <abbr title="Master">Master</abbr>, you kill many of us every day without necessity. 
        One animal a day is enough to satisfy your hunger. Please come to an understanding.
         Starting from today, we promise to offer one amongst us to you every day. 
         In this way, you will not have to hunt and many of our lives will be spared.</q></p>
         <hr/>
 
   <p> Hearing this, the lion agreed, <q>It is true, but I warn you, if I do not receive an animal every day, 
        I shall proceed to kill every one of you.</q>
        In accordance to the understanding, the animals drew lots, and the unlucky animal that got chosen was sent to the lion.
         The others roamed about the jungle without any fear of being attacked by the lion.
         One day, a hare was chosen. Unwilling to become the lion's food, he started for the <b>lion's den. </b>
         He walked as slowly as possible.</p>
         <hr/>
    <p>On the way, the hare came across a well.
          It peeked down from the edge and when it saw it's own reflection, he hit upon a plan.
          He thought, <q>I have a plan that will not fail. I will deceive the lion and lead him to his death.</q>
