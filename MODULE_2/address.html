        <p><font color="red">There are 5 subjects.</font></p>
        <h3><font color="green">PHYSICS</font></h3>
        <P><font color="red">Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and that studies the related entities of energy and force.
        </br><b>Physics</b> is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.
        </font></P>
        <h4><font color="green">MATHS</font></h4>
        <P><font color="red"><b>MATHEMATICS</b> includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.
        </br> It has no generally accepted definition. </br>Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures;
             they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof.
            </font> </P>
        <h5><font color="green"><b>CHEMISTRY</b></font></h5>
        <P><font color="red">Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties,
             behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances
            </font></P>
        <h6><font color="green"> <b>COMPUTER SCIENCE</b></font> </h6>
        <P><font color="red">Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. </br>Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software
             and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.
