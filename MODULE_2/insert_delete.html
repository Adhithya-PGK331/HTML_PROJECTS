        <h3><font color="green">PHYSICS</font></h3>
        <P><dfn>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and that studies the related entities of energy and force.
            </dfn>
            <font color="red"></br><b>Physics</b> is 2<sup>nd</sup> most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.

        <h4><font color="green">MATHS</font></h4>
        <P><font color="blue"><b>MATHEMATICS</b> includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.
        </br> It has no generally accepted definition. </br>Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures;
             they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof.
