                <h3>Parambikulam Tiger Reserve</h3>
                    
                
                Parambikulam Tiger Reserve is situated in Chittur taluk of Palakkad district and is

                    <h3>Trek to Thoovanam falls</h3>
                        <p>
                                
                                It is a popular trekking trail in Munnar. Perhaps a trek to 
                                Thoovanam falls in the jungle is the best way to get to the soul 
                                of Chinnar. This 4 km trekking trail starts from Alampetty Check post. 
                                It is a guided programme which usually takes 3 hours from the check post.
                                 This is a moderate level trek and you find in the Chinnar River which 
                                 accompanies you on one side, your best comrade. The sight of Thoovanam 
                                 waterfalls from a distance itself takes away all the fatigue of the long
                                  trek under a punishing sun.

                                    the kind of night one could spend in Chinnar. You stay in the
                                     middle of a vast forest where (the guide tells you in a tone 
                                     of an understatement), every animal you can expect in a forest 
                                     like this has dutifully registered its presence.  
                                     The stay includes dinner and breakfasts.
