        <h2>SUBJECTS</h2>
        <p>There are 5 subjects.</p>
        <h3>PHYSICS</h3>
        <P>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and that studies the related entities of energy and force.
             Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.</P>
        <h4>MATHS</h4>
        <P>Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change. It has no generally accepted definition. Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures;
             they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. </P>
        <h5>CHEMISTRY</h5>
        <P>Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties,
             behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances</P>
        <h6>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h6>
        <P>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software
             and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.</P>
